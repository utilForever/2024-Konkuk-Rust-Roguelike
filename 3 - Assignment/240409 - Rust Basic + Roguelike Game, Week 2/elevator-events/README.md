# Exercise: Elevator Events

We will create a data structure to represent an event in an elevator control
system. It is up to you to define the types and functions to construct various
events. Use `#[derive(Debug)]` to allow the types to be formatted with `{:?}`.

This exercise only requires creating and populating data structures so that
`main` runs without errors. The next part of the course will cover getting data
out of these structures.
